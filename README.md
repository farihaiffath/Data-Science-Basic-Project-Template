# Data-Science-Basic-Project-Template
This project includes the basic pipeline of a data science workflow. It starts with defining the problem and gathering the necessary data. The data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis, followed by an exploration phase to understand key patterns and insights. Next, machine learning models are built and tested to find the best solution.

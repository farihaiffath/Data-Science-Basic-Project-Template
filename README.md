# Data-Science-Basic-Project-Template
This project includes the basic pipeline of a data science workflow. It starts with defining the problem and gathering the necessary data. The data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis, followed by an exploration phase to understand key patterns and insights. Next, machine learning models are built and tested to find the best solution. 

## Template_Function.ipynb: 
This notebook provides a modular classification pipeline with functions for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It promotes reusability and clean code through the use of functions for each step.

## Classification_Template_WO_Function.ipynb: 
This template follows the classification workflow without using functions, making it more straightforward but less modular. It is suitable for small projects where simplicity is preferred over code reusability.

## Template_WO_healthcare_data.ipynb: 
This notebook is a classification template tailored for healthcare data, guiding users through preprocessing and model building. It can be customized for healthcare-specific challenges, like imbalanced data or privacy concerns.
